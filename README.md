# NYPL Kids Responsive Theme
This theme repurposes the work done by Development Geeks on the respond theme for kids.nypl.org.    This is a fork of an Omega subtheme. This theme meets the purposes of kids.nypl.org and is not meant to a repurposeable responsive solution. See the projects below for generalizable solutions:

Links:  
* Drupal project page: http://drupal.org/project/respond  
* Blog post on dev geeks: http://developmentgeeks.com/project/respond  
* Github repo: https://github.com/ThemeGeeks/Respond
* Omega project page: http://drupal.org/project/omega

Some issues to note:

Always use a primary navigation of 6 items. Do not use an odd number of nav items with this theme, it will look terrible and break the nav's responsiveness.

Todo:  
* IE 8, 9 and 10 testing  
* Lots of kids.nypl.org specific tweaking
